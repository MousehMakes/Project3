            DreamCatcher is a web application to help individual users connect with their personal goals. Once a user signs up for the site, they can log in to access their own unique profile page. They can also view their personal vision board page to record and track their career, travel, and personal goals. DreamCatcher is linked to the Spotify API and can play calming music in the background while the user works on their page.
